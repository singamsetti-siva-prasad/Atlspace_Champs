# Alt Space Champs

ALT Space Champs collection is made up of 20,000 randomly generated NFTs that exist on the Polygon blockchain. The holders of ALT Space Champs NFTs can participate in an exclusive forum that brings together Web3 builders under 1 roof. Keep in mind that all Champs have caps, and that's what makes them different from everyone else in ALT Space.

## Demo

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
`npm start`

```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console

## Run Tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Eject

```bash
 npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
